# An example of how to use AngularJS to enhance web content

[View the blog post](http://www.ducksoupdev.co.uk) for this example project.

## Overview

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is widely used for [SPAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) but is not necessarily everyone's first choice for enhancing web content - [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and other libraries are typically used for DOM manipulation.

However, with it's directive API, using AngularJS to enhance web content is a powerful alternative and can be used where [semantic mark-up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_presentation_and_content) and [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) is important.

This example project is a carousel view for both mobile and desktop which makes use of Bootstrap v3 components carousel and collapse.
